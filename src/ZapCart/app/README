ZapCart - Material shopping cart
================================

A little AngularJS app to understand some of the concepts better and get a feel for Browserify and Gulp too.

Scope
	- Prototypical inheritence
	- The purpose of the scope if to refer to the model not to be the model
	- The model is your JavaScript objects
	- Treat scope as read-only in templates
	- Treat scope as write-only in controllers
	- When doing bidirectional binding (ng-model) make sure you don't bind directly to the scope properties:
	- ng-model - always have a dot!

Factories vs. Services
	Simplest first:

	- Service: Register a service constructor, which will be invoked with new to create the service instance
	- Factory: Register a service factory, which will be called to return the service instance.
	- Provider: Provider style, full blown, configurable version
